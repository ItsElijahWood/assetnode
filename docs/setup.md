# üöÄ Setup Guide for Asset Node

## Prerequisites  
Before setting up Asset Node, ensure you have the following installed:  

- **Docker** (Required for running Apache, MySQL, and phpMyAdmin locally)  
- **Docker Compose** (For managing multi-container applications)  
- **PHP** (For running the project)  
- **Composer** (Dependency manager for PHP)  

> ‚ö† **Note:** The `config.php` file is not included in this repository as it contains tokens. The developer will provide this file separately.

## üöÄ Running the Project  

1. Navigate to the project root and run:
   ```bash

   ```
   This starts Apache, MySQL, and phpMyAdmin in Docker containers.

2. Open a browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:80
   ```
   The project should now be accessible.

3. Access phpMyAdmin at:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```
   Use the MySQL credentials defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

## üéØ Additional Notes  
- Ensure `config.php` is placed in the project root before running the application.  
- Check the running Docker containers with:  
  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```  
- Stop the project when not in use:
  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```
